# ðŸ“± Manual APK Creation Guide

Since you don't want to install Java locally, here are alternative ways to get your APK:

## Option 1: GitHub Actions (Easiest)

1. **Create a GitHub repository**:
   - Go to github.com
   - Create new repository "WhistleCounter"
   - Make it public

2. **Upload your code**:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/WhistleCounter.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Get your APK**:
   - Go to Actions tab in your repository
   - Wait for build to complete (2-3 minutes)
   - Download APK from artifacts

## Option 2: Online Build Services

### Bitrise (Free)
1. Go to bitrise.io
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. It will auto-detect Android project
4. Build and download APK

### AppVeyor (Free for public repos)
1. Go to appveyor.com
2. Connect GitHub repository
3. Add Android build configuration
4. Get APK download link

## Option 3: Use Android Studio (One-time setup)

1. Download Android Studio (free)
2. Open the project folder
3. Let it sync and build
4. Get APK from app/build/outputs/apk/debug/

## Option 4: Docker Build (Advanced)

If you have Docker installed:
```bash
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app -w /app openjdk:11-jdk ./gradlew assembleDebug
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Recommended: GitHub Actions**

This is the most reliable and free option. The workflow I created will:
- âœ… Work without Java on your machine
- âœ… Build the APK automatically
- âœ… Provide download link
- âœ… Work every time you push code changes
